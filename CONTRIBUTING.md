# Contributing to Pivotal Projects

Weâ€™d love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. Please review the following guidelines you'll need to follow in order to make a contribution.

## Contributor License Agreement

All contributors to this project must have a signed Contributor License Agreement (**"CLA"**) on file with us. The CLA grants us the permissions we need to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project; you or your employer retain the copyright to your contribution. Head over to https://cla.pivotal.io/ to see your current agreement(s) on file or to sign a new one.

We generally only need you (or your employer) to sign our CLA once and once signed, you should be able to submit contributions to any Pivotal project.

Note: if you would like to submit an "_obvious fix_" for something like a typo, formatting issue or spelling mistake, you may not need to sign the CLA. Please see our information on [obvious fixes](https://cla.pivotal.io/about#obvious-fix) for more details.

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review and we use GitHub's pull requests for this purpose. Please consult [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) if you need more information about using pull requests.

## Direct commits to the repository

On occasion you will see core team members committing directly to the repository without going through the pull request workflow. This is reserved for small changes only and the rule of thumb we use is this: if the change touches any functionality that may result in a test failure, then it has to go through a pull request workflow. If, on the other hand, the change is in the non-functional part of the code base (such as fixing a typo inside of a comment block) core team members can decide to just commit to the repository directly.
